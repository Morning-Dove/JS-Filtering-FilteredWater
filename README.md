# Filtered Water Project
This project is a simple web application that allows users to filter out contaminants from a list of water contaminants. The user can specify which contaminants to remove, and the application will display the filtered results.

## Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file for the project.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the HTML page.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for filtering water contaminants.

## Usage
Open index.html in a web browser.
The current water condition will be displayed.
Click the "Filter Water" button.
Enter the contaminants you want to filter out, separated by commas, in the prompt box.
The filtered results will be displayed on the page.

## Customization
To change the initial list of water contaminants, modify the waterInput array in the script.js file.
